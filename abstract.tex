Major advances in our understanding of the
Universe frequently arise from dramatic improvements in our ability to accurately 
measure astronomical quantities. Aided by rapid progress in information 
technology, current sky surveys are changing the way we view and study the
Universe. Next-generation surveys will maintain this revolutionary 
progress. We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in 
the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array
of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey and 
LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is 
driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, 
taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, 
and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system 
designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky that is visible from
Cerro Pach\'{o}n in Northern Chile. The current baseline design, with an 8.4 m 
(6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel 
camera, will allow about 10,000 square degrees of sky to be covered using pairs 
of 15-second exposures \R{in two photometric bands} \B{twice per night} every three 
nights on average, with typical 5$\sigma$ depth for point sources of $r\sim24.5$ (AB). 
The system is designed to yield high image quality as well as superb astrometric 
and photometric accuracy. The project is in the construction phase and will begin the 
regular survey operations by the beginning of next decade. The \B{total} survey area will 
include 30,000 deg$^2$ with $\delta<+34.5^\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times 
in six bands, $ugrizy$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. 
About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode 
which will \B{uniformly} observe a 18,000 deg$^2$ 
region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years 
of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\sim27.5$. These data will result in 
databases including 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and will 
serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time 
will be allocated to special projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain 
survey. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system 
parameters, and describe the expected data products and their characteristics. 
The goal is to make LSST data products  and a relational database of about 32
trillion observations of 40 billion objects available to the public and scientists around the 
world -- everyone will be able to view and study a high-definition color movie of 
the deep Universe.
